🛒 Cartify – Full Stack MERN E-Commerce Platform
✨ Cartify is a full-featured MERN stack e-commerce website built as my first major MERN project.
The project took ~23 days to build and the main focus was learning real-world application flow, not just UI polish.

Authentication flow
Redux state management
Backend API design
Real-world project structure
